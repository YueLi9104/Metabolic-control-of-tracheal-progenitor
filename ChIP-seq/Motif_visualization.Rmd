# Motif visualization
### This Rmd document will use the motif matrices extracted from Homer results(.txt files) to visualize motifs.
```{r}
## loading packages
library(seqLogo)
```

```{r visualization,fig.height=6,fig.width=6}
motif_matrix <- read.csv("./motif_file/aef1.txt", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
pwm <- makePWM(t(motif_matrix))
seqLogo(pwm)
motif_matrix <- read.csv("./motif_file/kr.txt", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
pwm <- makePWM(t(motif_matrix))
seqLogo(pwm)
motif_matrix <- read.csv("./motif_file/trl.txt", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
pwm <- makePWM(t(motif_matrix))
seqLogo(pwm)
motif_matrix <- read.csv("./motif_file/sd.txt", sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
pwm <- makePWM(t(motif_matrix))
seqLogo(pwm)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
